                    <p>So, I was asked to make some HTML and jazz it up with some CSS, and here's what I 
                        came up with. Whether you know it already or not, I'm here to tell you that right 
                        now there is only one New York team for me.</p>
                    <p>And that team is the <a id="nyr" href="https://www.nhl.com/rangers">New&nbspYork&nbspRangers!</a></p>

                    <p>So, I know what you're thinking, 'Hockey? Who cares about hockey?'<br>
                    <br>
                    You wanna know who?<br>
                    <br>
                    THIS GUY!!!</p>
                    <img src="file:///C:/Users/User/lc101/html-me-something/images/JATRangers.jpg" alt="Yours Truly">
                    <p>Yep, that's right! Yours Truly, in my Beukeboom jersey and Rangers hat, standing in 
                    front of the Rangers game (on the TV, unfortunately).<br>
                    <br>
                    Now for those of you unfamiliar with The World's Most Famous Arena, this is a pic 
                    of Madison Square Garden, the home of the New York Rangers!</p>
                    <div id="msg">
                        <img src="file:///C:/Users/User/lc101/html-me-something/images/MSG.jpg" alt="MSG">
                    </div>
                    <p>Yes, they know it's round, but that's not what it's named for. And as you can see, 
                    it's lit up in all it's Blue, Red, and White Glory!
                    (Rumor has it that there's some other team that plays basketball or something there, 
                    but I couldn't care any &lt I already don't)<br>
                    <br>
                    How many times have I been to a Ranger game at The Garden? I really can't recall, 
                    and unfortunately due to a tragic storage unit mishap, I've lost all my ticket stubs, 
                    but there were plenty of those! So, if you were wondering why my phone makes a funny 
                    foghorn sound occasionally, followed by a "GO RANGERS!" fist-pump from me &amp my kids, 
                    it's because they just scored a goal. And if you see me checking my phone like a 13 year 
                    old girl on SnapCrack (not mentioning any names here), it's because as much as I enjoy 
                    the company of others, well, I've got priorities...</p>
