            <h1>Hockey and HTML?</h1>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p>So, I was asked to make some HTML and jazz it up with some CSS, and here's what I came up with.</p>
        <p>Whether you know it already or not, I'm here to tell you that right now there is only one New York team for me.</p>
        <p>And that team is the <a href="https://www.nhl.com/rangers">New&nbspYork&nbspRangers!</a></p>

        <p>So, I know what you're thinking, 'Hockey? Who cares about hockey?'</p>
        <p>You wanna know who?</p>
        <p>THIS GUY!!!</p>
        <img src="file:///C:/Users/User/lc101/html-me-something/images/JATRangers.jpg" alt="Yours Truly">
        <p>Yep, that's right! Yours Truly, in my Beukeboom jersey and Rangers hat, standing in front of the Rangers game (on the TV, unfortunately).</p>
        <p>Now for those of you unfamiliar with The World's Most Famous Arena, this is a pic of Madison Square Garden, the home of the New York Rangers!</p>
        <img src="file:///C:/Users/User/lc101/html-me-something/images/MSG.jpg" alt="MSG">
        <p>Yes, they know it's round, but that's not what it's named for. And as you can see, it's lit up in all it's Blue, Red, and White Glory!</p>
        <p>(Rumor has it that there's some other team that plays basketball or something there, but I couldn't care any &lt I already don't)</p>
        <p>How many times have I been to a Ranger game at The Garden? I really can't recall, and unfortunately due to a tragic storage unit mishap, I've lost all my ticket stubs, but there were pleanty of those!</p>
        <p>So, if you were wondering why my phone makes a funny foghorn sound occasionally, followed by a "GO RANGERS!" fist-pump from me &amp my kids, it's because they just scored a goal.</p>
        <p>And if you see me checking my phone like a 13 year old girl on SnapCrack (not mentioning any names here), it's because as much as I enjoy the company of others, well, I've got priorities...</p>
